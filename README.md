## Hi, I’m Alka! 👋

I bring over seven years of software engineering experience, including roles at **Microsoft** and **PayPal**. I’ve worked on large-scale systems that enhanced data center security and reliability, merchant enterprise insights and ecommerce developer experience, and I’m now focused on deepening my system design and backend architecture expertise as I pursue interviews to re-enter the tech industry.

As a curious and mission-driven software engineer I'm exploring **AI agents**, **cloud automation**, and intelligent internal tools. I recently shipped a quick prototype [AWS TagSense](https://github.com/alkasharma-eng/aws-tagsense-ai-assistant) — a GPT-powered assistant that helps cloud teams identify and explain untagged EC2 instances using natural language. This work blends **Python**, **Streamlit**, **OpenAI APIs**, and **AWS** to build smart, accessible developer tools.

### 🔧 What I'm Working On

- 🤖 Exploring agentic AI and building small tools that offload cognitive load for developers
- 📊 Designing UIs that make cloud governance feel *natural* and intelligent
- 🎓 Taking [Google’s 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents) to deepen my understanding of production-ready agent systems

---

### 🌟 Featured Projects

- [`AWS TagSense`](https://github.com/alkasharma-eng/aws-tagsense-ai-assistant): A natural language tagging assistant for EC2, built with Streamlit + OpenAI + Boto3
- `cloud-ai-experiments`: A playground for ideas that blend cloud ops with conversational AI (coming soon)

---

### 🌱 I’m Looking For

I'm actively seeking **my next professional software role and collaborations** where I can:

- Build or contribute to **AI-driven developer tools**, internal agents, or platform products
- Work with **thoughtful teams** at the intersection of **AI + cloud infrastructure**
- Learn from product-minded mentors and contribute with energy and care
